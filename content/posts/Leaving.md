I feel we sometimes need to leave 

Like all those people who ended up hurting us over and over again , getting more out of us always, treating us a part time friend

Leaving feelings

Like sometimes we unexpectedly fall in love and the person would move on as it if never existed and that really hurts to the core

Leaving traumas

Sometimes there are moments or certain things which certain people at a higher position say to you and they don't even realise that they hurt you but now what can you do ? see according to me, time heals everything so just be patient there might be glimpse of those traumatic moments playing loud in your head but that will fade away that's what i have seen
