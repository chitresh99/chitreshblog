Mystery

I have always loved dark and mysterious stuff ever since I was a kid the mystery of the darkness excites me more than anything

Be it the Goth culture or the horror movies or other paranormal stuff I enjoy it a lot 

Darkness has always excited me but Falling into that darkness horrifies me 

That's pure suffocation and pain
