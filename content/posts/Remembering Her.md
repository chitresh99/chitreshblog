Remembering her

The song 'remembering her' is just an instrumental of keys there is something really mysterious and dark about that song 

Whenever I listen to it I find my self imagining me walking on a empty road in a forest full of Sakura blossom and later there is a crossroad 

I pick one path and keep walking while still being in the forest of Sakura blossom there is a shop in the forest I find two people wearing masks as I am passing them , they look at me and keep staring at me and once I pass them I find myself at another crossroads 

I still don't know what this means but this means something
