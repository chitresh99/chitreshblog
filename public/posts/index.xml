      <description>Well well where do i start umm
Lets start with feelings how do i feel at the moment ? I feel anxious about the future
There is so much happening in the world rightnow trying to keep up with all of that sometimes gets you demotivated
Also i am tired, i need to find a way through which I can distribute my energy wisely
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what i am talking right now i can&amp;rsquo;t express it i am not sad and i am not happy either</description>

      <description>Hello World! Welcome to my first blog post on chitreshblog.
Why did I start this ? To share what i am doing , basically i am doing new stuff like everyday so sharing on instagram everyday is such a drag plus a lot of people asked me why did I stop my last blog after my first post because It was too much of writing code but eh I found a simpler way,so expect new blogs</description>
